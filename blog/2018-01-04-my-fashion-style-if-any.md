# My Humble Fashion
My fashion sense is basic. I like leisure athletic attire. I have an affinity to black and white since they're dead simple to match. Athletic leisure is also very comfortable. Clothes are meant to be comfortable! Wear your clothes, don't be worn by your clothes.

Have the same opinion? This is my current wardrobe. Full disclosure, they're affiliate links. The quality from amazon is top notch. Adidas never fails me. And Next Level shirts are super cheap. You'll see me wearing this on a daily basis if it's appropriate. Spoiler: it's almost always appropriate to wear what I'm wearing.
