What is interesting about web traffic? There's a plethora of ways you can slice and dice web traffic, but what's most interesting? Though you can pick any dimension, let's focus on user locales. a user locale is defined as the geographic region and language spoken. The US for example is given a locale en_US. Great Britain on the other hand is en_GB. Great so, we have some knowledge that our users come from a certain locale. Now what?

Why do we care about web traffic? It may be that this web traffic is a signal towards other revenue impacting activities. Say we have a support page. The support page caters all available user locales. What do we want to know about this support page? This is not at all an exhaustive list, but it can leads us towards some interesting answers.

How many locales are there?
How many locales are supported?
On average, how many visits come from each locale?
On average, how many visitors come from each locale?
Does the day of the week, day of the month, or day of the year have an impact on visits and visitors?
What are the distributions of the locales on a given day?
Do these change over time?
On average, what are the user locale distributions of visitors?
On average, what are the user locale distributions of visits?
What are the top locales?
How many are the top locales?
What locales are on the tail end?
How many locales account for the tail end?
How much of the traffic do top locales account for?
How do the top locales rank?
Do ranks change over time?
For a given locale how many visits does a visitor perform?
Do visits per visitor change over time?
What locales have the most frequent visitors?

So now we know more about the support page. Why do we care?

The support page can lead to a support case. The case is handled by an agent. It can be expensive to scale support by agents. An anomaly on web traffic may be a signal to an increase in cases.

Here's some more questions to answer.
How many cases are being filed by a given locale?
How many users are filing cases for a given locale?
How many cases are being filed by a user in a given locale?
Do these change over time?
What are the distributions of all these metrics over time?
Is there a disparity between who visits and who files?
What are the top locales that file?
what locales have the most frequent filers?
How much do these top locales account for?
which of these measurements are most correlated?
