### How to Use This Book

### Diary of the Madman
- Time Ferris is a self described madman having tracked most everything he's done in life. It stands to reason his methodical approach has some validity.
### The Unintentional Dark Horse
- Tim Ferrris takes full advantage of being an outsider to academia unrestricted red tape when exploring approaches to use.
### A Laboratory of One
- Seperation of expertise between doctors and body builders means both sides suffer suboptimal results. Tim seeks to take from both paradigms.
### The Future's Already Here
- It's just unevenly distributed. A lot of the solutions exist, they're just not available to everyone.
### The 80/20 Principle: From Wall Street to the Human Machine
- Vilfredo Pareto's "law" 80% of the welath and income is produced by the 20%. With that in mind the book is the 2.5% of knowledge that leads to 95% of the results.
### How to Use This Book - Five Rules
- Rule 1: The book is a buffet. Pick one appearance goal and one perfromance goal to start. Only mandatory chapters are Fundamentals and Ground Zero.
- Rule 2: Skip the science if it's too dense. It's not mandatory to get results.
- Rule 3: Please be skeptical. The how to is reliable, some of the why may not.
- Rule 4: Dont't use skepticism as an excuse for inaction. Be proactively skeptical not defensively skeptical.
- Rule 5: Enjoy it. Have fun with it.
### The Billionaire Productivity Secret and the Experimental Lifestyle
- How to be more productive - according to Richard Branson, "work out"

# Fundamentals First and Foremost
## The minimum effective does
### From Microwaves to Fat-loss
- You don't need to understand radiation to microwave something. Similarly, you don't have too be too concerned with how the mechanisms work.
### The minimum effective dose
- The smallest dose that will produce the desired results. Anything more is wasteful. 
- To remove stored fat -> do the least necessary to trigget a fat-loss cascade of specific hormones.
- To add muscle in small or large quantities -> do the least necessary to trigger local (specific muscles) and systemic (hormonal) growth mechanisms
- 80 seconds is the dose prescription

## Rules that Change the Rules
### Everythig Popular is Wrong
- Developing mental models, or analytical rules of thumb are heuristics or analytical frameworks that lead the way.
- "Even people who aren't geniuses can outhink the rest of mankind if they develop certain thinking habits."
### New rules for rapid redesign
- No excercise burns that many calories. Instead use two unexploited ways to lose fat: heat and hormones.
### A drug is a drug is a drug.
-Anything you put into your mouth or your bloodstream is effectively a drug.
### The 20 Pound Recomp Goal
- A 20 pound change in appearance is notable. Can be a combination of fat loss and muscle gain. 
### The 100 Unit Slider: Diet, Drugs, and Excercise
- Percentages you choose depend on personal preferences and adherence.
### The duct tape test: will it stick?
- avoid all methods with high failure rates
 will you actually stick with this change until you hit your goal> if not, find another methode eve if it's less affective and less efeicnet. the decent method you follow is better than the perfect method you quit.

 dont confuse [hyscal recreation with excercise - "recreations is for fun ecercise is for produceing changes. dont confuse the 2"
dont confuse corelation with cause and effect - be skeptical of sensationalist headlines.

use the yo-yo embrace cycling -
forget balance and embrace cycling. it's a key ingredeint inr apid body redesign. 

predisposition v predestinatio: don't blame your genes
it is possible to redirect your natural bon genetic profile. Genetics isn't an excuse.

Eliminate propoganda and nebulous terms - ask, if this mentod /product/diet etc didn't work as advertised what might be another intencitve for selling it? To elimiante wordes you whoulsnt' use ask, can i measure it?

WHy a calorie isn't a calorie.
rule 1 it's not waht you put in your mouth that matters, it's what makes it to your bloodsteam. if it passes through it doens't count.
rule 2 hormonal responsese to carbohydrates (CHO) protein, and fat are difference.
